# Walmart Weekly Sales Prediction

This project builds a machine learning model to predict Walmart's weekly sales using a **Random Forest Regressor**, deployed through a **Streamlit web application**. It helps stakeholders forecast sales trends and make data-driven decisions in inventory planning, staffing, and promotional strategies.

## Project Summary

- **Model Used:** Random Forest Regressor  
- **Goal:** Predict weekly sales based on historical data and store-level features  
- **Interface:** Interactive Streamlit application  
- **EDA Features:** Dataset info, summary statistics, missing values, types, and structure  
- **End-User Input:** Sidebar form to simulate custom predictions  

---

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn**  
- **Streamlit** for app deployment  
- **VS Code** for local development  
- **Jupyter/Colab** for testing

---

## Features

- Interactive web UI built with Streamlit
- Automatic model training using Random Forest Regressor
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with toggles
- User input form to simulate predictions
- Evaluation via R² Score

---

## Files Included

- Streamlit web app script  
- Raw dataset used for training  
- Visual asset displayed in the app  

---

## Setup Instructions

To run the app locally:

1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn streamlit
````

3. Run the app

```bash
streamlit run app4.py
```
